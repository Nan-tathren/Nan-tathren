# Hi there,

My name is **Tomas** and my handle here is Nan-tathren (I could not think of anything else). I'm a aspiring Data analyst with a strong interest in Business/Data analysis and Python.

So far I only have a couple of projects here. The news scrapper is my creation without reliance on any tutorial. For the "Company_Blog" and the 'To-Do List' projects I got the inspiration from online university courses I follow. The last file showcases queiries in PostgreSQL I have practiced in real databases.

**Currently I am learning Data analyst stuff using Python, SQL, Power BI**

You can check out my repositories below to see what I’ve been working on. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate!

## My Journey into IT

After spending years in a completely different work field, I made the decision to pursue a career in IT. It hasn't been an easy road, though. Transitioning into IT demands a lot of time, effort, and perseverance — especially since I'm juggling my **non-IT full-time job**, a **side hustle**, and **family responsibilities**.

The challenge of balancing all these commitments while learning new technologies and building projects has been tough, but worth it. Every step of the way, I've had to develop strong **resilience**, **time management** skills, and a deeper ability to **stay committed to my personal goals** despite the obstacles.

Despite the challenges, I remain motivated to keep learning and growing in this field.
