# Hi there,

My name is **Tomas** and my handle here is Nan-tathren (I could not think of anything else). I'm a aspiring software/web developer with a strong interest in Python.

So far I only have a couple of projects here. The news scrapper is my creation without reliance on any tutorial. For the 'Expense tracker' project I got the inspiration from the internet. The last file showcases queiries in PostgreSQL I have practiced in real databases. 
You can check out my repositories below to see what I’ve been working on. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate!

## My Journey into IT

After spending years in a different work field, I decided to pursue a career in software/web development. It hasn’t been easy, though. Transitioning to IT requires a lot of time, effort, and perseverance, especially since I’m juggling my non-IT full-time job, a side hustle, and my family responsibilities. The challenge of balancing all these commitments while learning new technologies and building projects has been tough. The process of switching careers has taught me resilience, time management, and how to stay committed to personal goals, no matter the obstacles.

After spending years in a completely different work field, I made the decision to pursue a career in software/web development. It hasn't been an easy road, though. Transitioning into IT demands a lot of time, effort, and perseverance — especially since I'm juggling my **non-IT full-time job**, a **side hustle**, and **family responsibilities**.

The challenge of balancing all these commitments while learning new technologies and building projects has been tough, but worth it. Every step of the way, I've had to develop strong **resilience**, **time management** skills, and a deeper ability to **stay committed to my personal goals** despite the obstacles.

Despite the challenges, I remain motivated to keep learning and growing in this field.
